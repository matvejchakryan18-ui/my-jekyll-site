I am Izergil,born Matvey Chakryan,a seeker of beauty in its fading breath. From the decadence of the 19th centuryand the trembling glow of urban night,I shape visions where phonk’s broken tapemeets the poetry of ruin. My art is a bouquet of shadows—flowers bruised, yet luminous—offered to those who hear musicin the depths of melancholy. If you seek a simple image, look elsewhere.If you seek atmosphere, memory, and darkness made beautiful,enter the world of Izergil.
